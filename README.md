## Why React?

- We can write **Composable** code
- Write components to create a larger more modular code base
- **Declarative** "Just tell me what to do and I'll get it done" where as Imperative you must tell the computer every step


### Add React to an existing website

React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Perhaps you only want to add some “sprinkles of interactivity” to an existing page. React components are a great way to do that. (from the Docs)

The majority of websites aren’t, and don’t need to be, single-page apps. With a few lines of code and no build tooling, try React in a small part of your website. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets. (from the Docs)
